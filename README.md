## C++ Principles - Forward Declaration
## Skills Demonstrated in Unreal Engine 5.4 Project

### C++ Programming:
- Writing and managing C++ code.
- Implementing classes, functions, and event handling.

### Component-Based Architecture:
- Designing game objects with static meshes, capsules, and custom components.

### Event Handling with Delegates:
- Using delegates to manage events in the health and damage system.
- Binding functions to delegates for health changes and damage events.

### Game Mechanics:
- Implementing movement, firing, health management, and damage application.
- Handling projectiles and hit events.

### User Interface Design:
- Creating UI elements for game start, countdown timers, and game over screens.

### Blueprints:
- Extending C++ classes with Blueprints for rapid prototyping.

### Debugging and Logging:
- Using Unrealâ€™s logging system to debug and track events.

### Optimization:
- Managing tick functions and event bindings for performance.
